# RTSP Camera Driver: RGB Stream Publisher

This application connects to an RTSP camera stream, decodes H.264/H.265 video into raw RGB frames using FFmpeg, and publishes each frame as an `ImageRgb888` message on the make87 platform.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Connects to RTSP video streams over TCP
- Decodes video frames using FFmpeg
- Converts frames to uncompressed RGB888
- Publishes frames to the `CAMERA_RGB` topic using the `ImageRgb888` message type
- Filters by stream index to support cameras with multiple outputs
- Automatically sets the `entity_path` as `/camera/<ip>/<uri_suffix>`

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

This app uses the following configuration values:

| Name               | Required | Default | Description                                   |
|--------------------|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| CAMERA_USERNAME    | Yes      | â€“       | Username for RTSP login                       |
| CAMERA_PASSWORD    | Yes      | â€“       | Password for RTSP login                       |
| CAMERA_IP          | Yes      | â€“       | IP address of the RTSP camera                 |
| CAMERA_PORT        | No       | 554     | RTSP port number                              |
| CAMERA_URI_SUFFIX  | No       | (empty) | Optional URI suffix (e.g., `stream1`, `live`) |
| STREAM_INDEX       | No       | 0       | Stream index for multi-stream cameras         |

## ðŸ“¤ Output

Each decoded frame is published as an `ImageRgb888` message on the `CAMERA_RGB` topic. The `Header` includes the current wallclock timestamp and the computed `entity_path`.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Only the latest decoded frame is kept in memory after decoding. Older frames are dropped to reduce latency.
- This app uses a `tokio::sync::watch` channel for efficient zero-queue, drop-old behavior.
- The `entity_path` is derived automatically from the RTSP URL: `/camera/<ip>/<uri_suffix>`.
